# html_pdf_url_extractor
This code mimics the Google search engine by accepting user inputs regarding search terms, no of urls to be included in the search output as well as a filename.  

The output saved in the current directory comprises: a textfile consisting of all the pdf urls from the search result, another textfile listing the html urls and a consolidated csv file with all the urls from the search.  This separation helps with any content extraction exercise further on.
